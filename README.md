# Astar-Pathfinding-Visualizer
This is an interactive Python application that visualizes the A* Pathfinding Algorithm to find the closest path between two nodes while also avoiding obstacles. 
# How it Works 
- The first left click on the grid adds the start node and the second click on the grid adds the end node
- Draw obstacles by left clicking the mouse and dragging the pointer around the grid
- To erase obstacles, right click over them and drag the pointer around
- To start the algorithm press the SPACEBAR button on the keyboard 
- To clear the board press the "c" key on the keyboard

# Diagonal Path 
My algorithm includes diagonal pathfinding. The algorithm not only checks the up, down, left, right neighbors, but also checks the diagonals and calculates and compares their F-score. This results in finding the most optimal path even faster!
